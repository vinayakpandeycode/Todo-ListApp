🚀 Web Development Journey – Day 10: To-Do List App 📋

Today marks my 10th day of web development practice, and I built a To-Do List App! ✅

🔹 Features of My To-Do List App:

🔸 Add Tasks: Users can add tasks to their to-do list.

 🔸 Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed once done.

 🔸 Delete Tasks: Users can remove completed or unnecessary tasks.

 🔸 Responsive UI: The app is fully responsive, making it accessible on all devices.

 🔸 Local Storage: Tasks remain saved even after refreshing the page.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

✔ HTML – Structure of the app

 ✔ CSS – Styling and UI design

 ✔ JavaScript – Functionality and interactivity

This project helped me strengthen my JavaScript skills, especially DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage.
